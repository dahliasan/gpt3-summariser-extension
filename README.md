# AI powered summariser

### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is my project for [buildspace's nights and weekend's season 2](https://buildspace.so/nights-and-weekends) cohort.

This is a chrome extension that automatically generate summaries of long or complex emails, allowing you to quickly understand the main points without having to read the entire message.

It is powered by OpenAI's GPT3.
