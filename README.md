This is my project for [buildspace's nights and weekend's season 2](https://buildspace.so/nights-and-weekends) cohort.

This is a chrome extension that automatically generate summaries of text, allowing you to quickly understand the main points without having to read the entire message.

It is powered by OpenAI's GPT3.
